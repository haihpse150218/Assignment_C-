# Introduction
Imagine you're an employee of a product retailer named FStore. Your manager
has asked you to develop a Windows Forms application for member management:
MemberID, MemberName, Email, Password, City, Country. The application has
a default account whose email is “admin@fstore.com” and password is
“admin@@” that stored in the appsettings.json.
The application has to support adding, viewing, modifying, and removing
products—a standardized usage action verbs better known as Create, Read,
Update, Delete (CRUD). This assignment explores creating an application using
Windows Forms with .NET Core, and C#. An "in-memory database" will be created
to persist the member's data, so a collection is called List will be used for reading
and managing data.
